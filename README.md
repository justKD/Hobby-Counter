# Hobby-Counter
 
### [This is an old, archived project. It was once available on the iOS app store, but it has not been recently maintained or updated.]

Hobby Counter was designed to keep track of various hobby projects such as knitting or table top gaming. Any number of counters could be added or removed per project, and the meta data for each counter could be customized individually. Finally, counters with a set maximum could be linked to another in order to track overflow.

The appstore pics are below.
